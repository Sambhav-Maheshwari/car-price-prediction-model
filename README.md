# Car-Price-Prediction-ML-Model

This machine learning model predicts the price of a car based on various features that influence its value. It utilizes linear regression, a popular algorithm for continuous value prediction tasks. The entire project involves:

Data Preparation:

NumPy and CSV: This part uses NumPy for numerical computations and pandas (likely imported alongside NumPy) to load the car data from a CSV file.
Data Cleaning: The data might undergo cleaning steps to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and format data appropriately for modeling.
Model Building:

Scikit-learn: The scikit-learn library provides tools for machine learning tasks. Here, it's used to implement the linear regression model.
Feature Engineering: This might involve creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
Training: The model is trained on a portion of the car data, where it learns the relationship between features and car prices.
Model Deployment:

Streamlit: This creates a user-friendly web application. Users can input car features, and the trained model predicts the car's price based on the learned relationship.

Overall Process:

1.Load car data from a CSV file using pandas (likely imported with NumPy).
2.Clean and prepare the data for modeling.
3.Define features that influence car price (e.g., mileage, year, make, model).
4.Create a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
5.Train the model on a portion of the data.
6.Evaluate the model's performance to assess its accuracy.
7.Build a Streamlit web app where users can input car features.
8.Use the trained model within the app to predict car prices based on user input.

Benefits:

Easy to understand: Linear regression offers a clear interpretation of how features affect car prices.
Fast predictions: Streamlit allows for quick price predictions through the web app.
